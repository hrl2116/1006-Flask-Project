    <p>Classes taken this semester: Intro to Python, Introductory Physics 
    Electricity and Optics, Computational Linear Algebra, Data Structures, 
    Intermediate Macroeconomics, University Writing</p>
    <p>My favorite class so far has actually been Intro to Java Lab because I 
    am a TA for the class. Not only do I get paid, but I also get to work with 
    my friends and help introduce newcomers to programming the ropes of CS</p>
